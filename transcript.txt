The future of humanity seems insecure. 
Rapid climate change, political division,  	0.48	5.2
our greed and failings make it hard to look at 
our species with a lot of optimism and so many  	5.68	4.8
people think our end is in sight. But humans have 
always thought they lived in the end times. Every  	10.48	6.0
generation assumes they’re important enough to 
witness the apocalypse and then life just goes on.	16.48	5.04
This is a problem because it 
leads to short term thinking  	22.56	2.72
and prevents us from creating the best world 
for ourselves and our descendents. What makes  	25.28	5.44
this worse is that we may actually BE living at 
an extremely critical moment in human history.  	30.72	5.2
To understand why, let us look at the 
temporal window of humanity and ask:	36.8	4.72
When will the last human be born and 
how many people will there ever be?	42.16	4.56
These sorts of estimates come with a 
lot of uncertainties, so please take  	55.36	3.52
them with a gigantic grain of salt. To get 
a sense of how many people there will be,  	58.88	5.2
let us see how many have already lived. Modern 
humans arose some 200 thousand years ago.  	64.08	6.0
They were uniquely good at 
making tools, telling stories,  	70.8	3.2
thinking abstractly, planning and working together 
in large groups beyond their close family.	74.0	4.8
Still there were not that many of us. Surpluses 
in food were sparse, survival was hard,  	79.68	6.16
life expectancy was low. It took us 150,000 
years to grow to a population of 2 million.  	85.84	6.72
Improvements were gradual and eventually 
led to the agricultural revolution,  	93.44	4.72
arguably the biggest change in our history. 
This was when our numbers really started  	98.16	5.2
growing. It took ten thousand more years to get 
to 300 million. But that increase was dwarfed  	103.36	5.92
by the industrial revolution. In 1800 there 
were a billion of us. The human population  	109.28	6.24
doubled in just 120 years and then again in 
fifty. Today, we number around 8 billion.	115.52	6.64
In total, over the last two hundred thousand years 
about 117 billion humans were born and lived,  	122.96	6.32
and 109 billion also died. Which means that 
about 7% of all humans that ever lived are alive  	129.28	6.8
right now. As many as were born in the first 
150,000 years of human history. Every minute,  	136.08	7.36
270 babies join the party. But there are not just 
more people, never before have we been as healthy  	143.44	7.2
and well off, or lived longer. With growing 
living standards our birth rates collapsed.  	150.64	5.52
The UN estimates that around the year 2100 
we will hit our population peak and there  	157.04	5.2
will be 125 million people born each year. 
It is pretty unlikely that birth rates will  	162.24	6.08
stay stable forever, but let’s pretend 
to make our thought experiment simpler.	168.32	4.08
How many people there will be in the future 
depends on when our species will die out.  	173.36	4.72
And here we find a lot of uncertainties. 
We are able to destroy ourselves through  	178.08	5.28
our own inventions – but we are also able to 
find solutions to avert catastrophic risk.	183.36	5.04
We can change the direction of planet killer 
asteroids but we’ve also invented nuclear weapons.  	189.12	4.72
We discovered antibiotics but also carry diseases 
across the globe in a matter of days. Our  	194.48	5.6
industrial system gave us an incredible standard 
of living but also changed the atmosphere in the  	200.08	4.64
process. It is very hard to say if human ingenuity 
will prolong or shorten our species’ lifespan.	204.72	7.44
If things go badly our end could come 
suddenly. But if we manage to avoid that,  	212.16	5.12
we could conceivably stick around for a long 
time. So every day we don’t destroy ourselves  	217.28	5.6
may mean life for an unfathomable number of 
humans. How many people are we talking about?  	222.88	5.52
It depends on how far our 
species is going to expand.	229.36	3.36
Scenario 1: Humans will never leave Earth	234.0	2.96
If we stay on our home planet, a good metric 
to look at is the extinction rate of animals  	238.24	4.72
that we get from the fossil record. The 
average lifespan of mammalian species is  	242.96	4.8
in the region of 1 million years, with 
some surviving up to 10 million years.  	247.76	3.92
Our close relative homo erectus 
survived for about 1.9 million years.	252.88	4.72
Let us be conservative and assume that humans 
will survive for a million years, which leaves  	258.64	4.88
us 800,000 more years to dawdle away. Assuming a 
stable birth rate of 125 million people each year,  	263.52	6.96
this means there are roughly 100 
TRILLION humans waiting to be born.  	270.48	3.68
850 times greater than the number 
of people that have ever lived.  	274.96	4.0
This would make everybody alive today only 
0.008% of all people that will ever live.	279.68	6.64
Think about where this leaves you. Instead 
of putting you at the end of the chaotic  	287.28	4.64
mess that was our past, it would mean you 
live at the very beginning of something big.  	291.92	4.72
The start of the human story rather than the 
end. Doesn’t this feel incredibly different?	297.36	5.76
And now consider that this may be 
an extremely pessimistic estimate.  	304.56	3.84
If we match the survival time of the most 
successful mammals, then our future numbers  	309.28	4.56
rise to 1.2 quadrillion people that have yet to be 
born. And even this seems far from our potential:  	313.84	7.2
As the sun slowly gets hotter and brighter, earth 
will remain habitable for about 500 million years,  	321.04	6.32
giving so many more potential people 
the chance to become actual people.	327.36	4.48
And now let’s begin to think big.	333.04	2.72
Scenario 2: Humans will leave Earth	337.2	2.88
We went from humans worshipping 
the moon, to humans walking on it,  	341.36	3.84
so who knows how much farther we can go? If we 
don't die out within the next few hundred years,  	345.2	5.2
ideas that seem outlandish right 
now become serious considerations.	350.4	4.32
If we believe that we have a chance of 
surviving for maybe millions of years,  	355.92	4.16
then we could expand onto the other planets 
or into our own artificial worlds. Life needs  	360.08	6.0
three things: a surface, resources and energy.  	366.08	3.2
Our Sun provides energy for billions of years and 
there is so much water and material floating in  	370.16	5.28
the asteroid and kuiper belt that we could 
sustain many times our current population.	375.44	4.4
Instead of living on planets, we could decide to 
construct our own artificial worlds and habitats.  	380.88	5.68
With resources and energy so abundant, we could 
try out different types of society and ways of  	387.12	5.12
life. An interconnected civilization spanning the 
solar system would create the basis of existence  	392.24	5.92
for an absurd number of individuals, orders of 
magnitude more than if we stick to earth, even  	398.16	5.12
if it only existed for a few million years. This 
future doesn’t have to be grim and dark as science  	403.28	6.88
fiction likes to paint it. With quadrillions of 
people waiting to be born, we will have billions  	410.16	5.68
of doctors working on curing cancer, billions 
of problem solvers working on ending poverty and  	415.84	5.6
billions of video game developers making life 
fun. More humans may actually mean more progress.	421.44	6.64
Another upside of leaving earth and spreading 
out is that it becomes much harder for us to  	429.84	4.56
become extinct, as you need a solar system 
wide catastrophe to catch everybody.  	434.4	4.8
So aside from nearby supernovae 
or Gamma Rays bursts,  	439.84	3.2
humanity would be relatively safe from 
extinction, maybe for billions of years.	443.04	4.24
If we manage to survive for that long, slow 
evolution or genetic engineering might split us  	448.48	5.2
into multiple species, or we might intentionally 
keep ourselves the same as we are now.  	453.68	4.72
So to account for that, we’ll just talk 
about people from now on, instead of humans.	459.2	4.64
Ok. Now let us think really big.	464.72	2.8
Szenario 3: People leave the Solar System	468.56	2.96
As enormous as the solar system is, it is just 
one star system among billions in the milky way.  	472.24	5.6
If future people can colonize, say, 100 billion 
stars and live there for 10 billion years, while  	478.72	5.84
each generating 100 million births per year, then 
we can expect something like a hundred Octillion  	484.56	5.68
lives to be lived in the future. This is a 1 with 
29 zeros, a hundred thousand trillion, trillion.	490.24	7.04
We can spin this up as much as we like. The 
Andromeda Galaxy will merge with the Milky way,  	498.08	5.52
adding another trillion stars for us to settle. 
Red Dwarfs stay active for up to a trillion  	503.6	5.2
years and future civilizations might even find 
energy for their habitats around black holes.  	508.8	5.36
A sufficiently advanced civilization of our 
descendants might even try to reach other  	515.12	4.56
galaxy groups. While these numbers are mind 
blowing, they may underestimate the number of  	519.68	5.44
unborn people by many orders of magnitude. If we 
divide the total energy available in a galaxy by  	525.12	6.0
the average energy needs of a single person, 
then we get a tredecillion potential lives.  	531.12	4.96
A million, trillion, trillion, 
trillion potential people.	536.88	3.84
Conclusion	542.24	0.64
Hopefully what has become evident is that 
if we don’t kill ourselves in the next  	543.6	3.68
few centuries or millennia, almost all humans 
that will ever exist, will live in the future.  	547.28	4.88
Which brings us back to us, in the present. 
We exist at a highpoint of human history,  	552.72	6.48
with incredible possibilities at our grasp. 
Technological, environmental and societal.  	559.2	6.56
What we do matters for all the 
people who do not exist yet.	566.72	3.36
So while it is not en vogue to think 
about humanity's long term future with  	570.88	3.68
optimism – or to think about it at all –, 
maybe this has given you a bit of perspective.  	574.56	4.48
If we screw up the present, so many 
people may never come to exist.  	579.92	3.92
Quadrillions of unborn humans are at our mercy.
Even if we go with fairly conservative estimates,  	584.56	6.48
the unborn are by far the largest group of people 
– and the most disenfranchised. Somebody who might  	591.04	6.64
be born in a thousand or even a million years 
deeply depends on us today for their existence.	597.68	5.2
This is why it is important to think about the 
distant future and why our presence is so crucial,  	603.84	5.76
why it matters what we do today. One day the 
last human will be born. We don’t know when.  	609.6	6.88
But if we change our perspective from 
us living at the end of the human story,  	616.48	4.32
to us living at the very beginning we can 
not only build a wonderful world for us  	620.8	4.8
and for them but also for 
countless numbers of others.	625.6	6.72
HUGE announcement: we are launching Kurzgesagt in 
six more languages! Arabic, Brazilian Portuguese,  	632.32	7.12
French, Hindi, Japanese and Korean, on top of our 
English, German and Spanish channels. To bring  	639.44	7.12
new perspectives and a love for science to as 
many people as possible – especially to some  	646.56	5.28
languages that are underserved because 
it is not profitable to translate to.  	651.84	4.0
If enough people watch our new channels, we 
hopefully can run them for many years to come!	656.4	3.92
This is where we need YOUR help. It takes us a 
lot of time, effort and yes, money to translate  	660.96	6.96
our videos properly and run so many channels 
– so to make this sustainable, please help  	667.92	5.76
us spread the word!If you are a native in one of 
these languages, share our videos on social media  	673.68	5.6
and tell your friends and family – make people 
in your native language aware that it exists.	679.28	4.8
This multi language expansion is 
supported by Open Philanthropy,  	684.8	3.44
an organization that tries to do as much good as 
possible. They want to help us spread awareness  	688.24	4.88
of science, and ideas for how YOU can help 
humanity thrive. Their values align with  	693.12	5.76
ours in many fundamental ways so we are going to 
work with them on more projects in the future.	698.88	4.48
So please help us spread the word 
– and thank you for watching.	703.92	11.92
